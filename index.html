        Hey There! I'm Mohit Soni!
        Welcome to my little corner of the internet! If you're here, you're
        probably wondering who I am and what I do. Well, buckle up, because
        I'm about to take you on a whirlwind tour of my journey so far!

        I'm currently a <b>Computer Science Major</b> at <b>Cornell University</b>.
        My academic journey is filled with algorithms, data structures, and
        a whole lot of late-night coding sessions.

      <p class="ext-description">
        Recently, during the summer of 2024, I worked as an <b>AI Software
          Developer Intern</b> at <b>BrickRed Systems</b>. I've been part of an
        amazing team of 25 people, working on EchoMD, an AI-powered platform
        that's shaking up the healthcare industry. My job? Making sure that
        doctors can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork.
        I developed and fine-tuned some nifty NLP algorithms using Python
        libraries like NLTK and SpaCy, all to transcribe doctor-patient
        dialogues in real-time. TensorFlow was my trusty sidekick
        in training and deploying these models. I also dabbled in backend magic
        with Django and Flask, whipping up RESTful APIs to keep everything
        running smoothly. The result? A 30% reduction in documentation time
        and a 25% increase in record accuracy.

        Not only that, under the mentorship of <b>Professor Madhur Srivastava</b> at
        the <b>Signal Science Lab</b> at <b>Cornell University</b>, I’m leading a research
        initiative to develop an algorithm that analyzes cricket batsmen's
        techniques based on video data. Think of it as a tech-driven coach that scrutinizes
        every stance, footwork, and bat swing. I crafted an innovative
        algorithm for video segmentation using pose estimation and dynamic
        time warping, ensuring we capture only the most relevant frames.

        But when I'm not busy working on my research project or internship, I like to let loose and
        have a little fun. That's where <b>Kaggle competitions</b> come in -
        it's the perfect way for me to show off my tech prowess and
        flex my analytical muscles. Plus, I'm always working on my
        own personal projects - because why not?

        Though I may look like your typical tech nerd, but
        I promise I'm not just a coding machine. I'm also a serious
        cricket player! I'm the <b>President of the Cornell Cricket Club</b> and
        I have been a member of the <b>U19 team at the National level</b>. Being part
        of this team sport has taught me so much about leadership, teamwork,
        and perseverance. From serving as the Captain of the Cornell Cricket Team playing for
        regional teams around Seattle, I've learned to motivate and communicate
        effectively with my teammates, identify their strengths and weaknesses,
        and help them improve their game.

        Cricket isn't my only passion – I've recently become an avid chess
        enthusiast too! I got hooked on the game during my senior year of high
        school, and now I play consistently, fitting in 2-3 games every day. I
        love the thrill of blitz and the strategic depth of rapid chess. My
        dedication has paid off with a rapid rating of 2000 and a blitz rating
        of 1700. Chess has taught me patience, focus, and strategic thinking,
        making it a perfect complement to my interests and a great way to stay
        sharp and competitive.
